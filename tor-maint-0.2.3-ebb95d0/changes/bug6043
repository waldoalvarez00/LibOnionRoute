  o Packaging (RPM):
    - Our default RPM spec files have been updated to work with mock
      and rpmbuild on RHEL/Fedora. They have an updated set of
      dependencies and conflicts, a fix for an ancient typo when creating
      the "_tor" user, and better instructions. Thanks to Ondrej
      Mikle for the patch series; fix for bug 6043.
