  o Minor bugfixes:
     - Add internal circuit construction state to protect against
       the noisy warn message "Unexpectedly high circuit_successes".
       Also add some additional rate-limited notice messages to help
       determine the root cause of the warn. Fixes bug 6475.
       Bugfix against 0.2.3.17-beta.
