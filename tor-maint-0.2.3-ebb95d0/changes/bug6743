  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Allow one-hop directory fetching circuits the full "circuit build
      timeout" period, rather than just half of it, before failing them
      and marking the relay down. This fix should help reduce cases where
      clients declare relays (or worse, bridges) unreachable because
      the TLS handshake takes a few seconds to complete. Fixes bug 6743;
      bugfix on 0.2.2.2-alpha, where we changed the timeout from a static
      30 seconds.
