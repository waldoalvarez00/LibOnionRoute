  o Major bugfixes:
    - When parsing exit policy summaries from microdescriptors, we had
      previously been ignoring the last character in each one, so that
      "accept 80,443,8080" would be treated by clients as indicating a
      node that allows access to ports 80, 443, and 808. That would lead
      to clients attempting connections that could never work, and
      ignoring exit nodes that would support their connections. Now clients
      parse these exit policy summaries correctly. Fixes bug 7192;
      bugfix on 0.2.3.1-alpha.
