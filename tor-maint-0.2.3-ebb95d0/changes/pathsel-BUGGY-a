  o Security fixes:

    - Try to leak less information about what relays a client is
      choosing to a side-channel attacker.  Previously, a Tor client
      would stop iterating through the list of available relays as
      soon as it had chosen one, thus finishing a little earlier
      when it picked a router earlier in the list.  If an attacker
      can recover this timing information (nontrivial but not
      proven to be impossible), they could learn some coarse-
      grained information about which relays a client was picking
      (middle nodes in particular are likelier to be affected than
      exits).  The timing attack might be mitigated by other factors
      (see bug #6537 for some discussion), but it's best not to
      take chances.  Fixes bug 6537; bugfix on 0.0.8rc1.
