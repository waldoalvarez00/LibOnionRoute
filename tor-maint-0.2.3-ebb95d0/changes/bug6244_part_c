  o Major bugfixes (controller):
    - Make wildcarded addresses (that is, ones beginning with *.) work when
      provided via the controller's MapAddress command.  Previously, they
      were accepted, but we never actually noticed that they were wildcards.
      Fix for bug 6244; bugfix on 0.2.3.9-alpha.
