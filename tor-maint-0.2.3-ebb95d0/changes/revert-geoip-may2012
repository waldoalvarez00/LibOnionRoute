  o Major bugfixes:
    - Revert to the May 1 2012 Maxmind GeoLite Country database. In the
      June 2012 database, Maxmind marked many Tor relays as country "A1",
      which will cause risky behavior for clients that set EntryNodes
      or ExitNodes. Addresses bug 6334; bugfix on 0.2.3.17-beta.
