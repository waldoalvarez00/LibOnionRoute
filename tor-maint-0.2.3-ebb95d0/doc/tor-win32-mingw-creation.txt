## Instructions for building Tor with MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/)
##

Stage One:  Download and Install MinGW.
---------------------------------------

Download mingw:
http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/MinGW-5.1.6.exe?download

Download msys:
http://prdownloads.sf.net/ming/MSYS-1.0.11.exe?download

Download msysDTK:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MSYS%20Supplementary%20Tools/msysDTK-1.0.1/msysDTK-1.0.1.exe/download

Install MinGW, msysDTK, and MSYS in that order.  

Make sure your PATH includes C:\MinGW\bin.  You can verify this by right
clicking on "My Computer", choose "Properties", choose "Advanced",
choose "Environment Variables", select PATH.

Start MSYS(rxvt).

Create a directory called "tor-mingw".

Stage Two:  Download, extract, compile openssl
----------------------------------------------

Download openssl:
http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.8l.tar.gz

Extract openssl:
Copy the openssl tarball into the "tor-mingw" directory.
Type "cd tor-mingw/"
Type "tar zxf openssl-0.9.8l.tar.gz"
(Note:  There are many symlink errors because Windows doesn't support
symlinks.  You can ignore these errors.)

Make openssl libraries:
Type "cd tor-mingw/openssl-0.9.8l/"
Type "./Configure -no-idea -no-rc5 -no-mdc2 mingw"
Edit Makefile and remove the "test:" and "tests:" sections.
Type "rm -rf ./test"
Type "cd crypto/"
Type "find ./ -name "*.h" -exec cp {} ../include/openssl/ \;"
Type "cd ../ssl/"
Type "find ./ -name "*.h" -exec cp {} ../include/openssl/ \;"
Type "cd .."
Type "cp *.h include/openssl/"
Type "find ./fips -type f -name "*.h" -exec cp {} include/openssl/ \;"
# The next steps can take up to 30 minutes to complete.
Type "make"
Type "make install"


Stage Three:  Download, extract, compile zlib
---------------------------------------------

Download zlib source:
http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz

Extract zlib:
Copy the zlib tarball into the "tor-mingw" directory
Type "cd tor-mingw/"
Type "tar zxf zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz"

CHOICE:

Make zlib.a:
Type "cd tor-mingw/zlib-1.2.3/"
Type "./configure"
Type "make"
Type "make install"

Done.


Stage Four: Download, extract, and compile libevent
------------------------------------------------------

Download the latest libevent release:
http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

Copy the libevent tarball into the "tor-mingw" directory.
Type "cd tor-mingw"

Extract libevent.

Type "./configure --enable-static --disable-shared"
Type "make"
Type "make install"

Stage Five:  Build Tor
----------------------

Download the current Tor alpha release source code from https://torproject.org/download.html.
Copy the Tor tarball into the "tor-mingw" directory.
Extract Tor:
Type "tar zxf latest-tor-alpha.tar.gz"

cd tor-<version>
Type "./configure"
Type "make"

You now have a tor.exe in src/or/.  This is Tor.
You now have a tor-resolve.exe in src/tools/.

Stage Six:  Build the installer
-------------------------------

Install the latest NSIS:
http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download

Run the package script in contrib:
From the Tor build directory above, run:
"./contrib/package_nsis-mingw.sh"

The resulting Tor installer executable is in ./win_tmp/.
