NAME
----
torify - wrapper for torsocks or tsocks and tor

SYNOPSIS
--------
**torify** __application__ [__application's__ __arguments__]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
**torify** is a simple wrapper that attempts to find the best underlying Tor
wrapper available on a system. It calls torsocks or tsocks with a tor specific
configuration file. +

torsocks is an improved wrapper that explicitly rejects UDP, safely resolves DNS
lookups and properly socksifies your TCP connections. +

tsocks itself is a wrapper between the tsocks library and the application that
you would like to run socksified. +

Please note that since both method use LD_PRELOAD, torify cannot be applied to
suid binaries.

WARNING
-------
You should also be aware that the way tsocks currently works only TCP
connections are socksified. Be aware that this will in most circumstances not
include hostname lookups which would still be routed through your normal system
resolver to your usual resolving nameservers. The **tor-resolve**(1) tool can be
useful as a workaround in some cases. The Tor FAQ at
https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ might have further
information on this subject. +

When used with torsocks, torify should not leak DNS requests or UDP data. +

Both will leak ICMP data.
