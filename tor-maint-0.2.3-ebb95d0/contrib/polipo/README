These are some hacks for making polipo work and install a package native
to Windows.

They need some work before they can be committed upstream:
  - Change the Makefile so it has a specific build such as "make
    dist-win32"
  - Configure the options for tor in polipo config, just leave them
    commented out for easy activation.
  - Work out better polipo config options for Tor.

As always, I'm happy to accept patches.

Pre-requisites for Windows
--------------------------

Polipo for Win32 requires the mingw gnu regex library and dlls at
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435&package_id=73286&release_id=140957

You'll need to download the -bin and -dev tarballs.  And extract them
into your MinGW directory.

Instructions for building polipo under mingw32 for Windows:
1) Copy Makefile.mingw over Makefile.
2) Run 'make'. 

You should have a polipo.exe in the current directory.

-------------------------------------------
Creating an installation package in Windows
-------------------------------------------

If you want to build an installer using the Nullsoft Installer, install
the NSI Compiler.  In Windows Explorer, navigate to the directory in
which you placed polipo-mingw.nsi.  Right click on polipo-mingw.nsi and
choose Compile NSIS Script.  You'll then create a polipo installer.

The Polipo NSI installer assumes libgnurx-0.dll is in the same directory as polipo.exe.
You'll need to copy libgnurx-0.dll into "./" in order to make the
installation package.
