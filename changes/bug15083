  o Major bugfixes (relay, stability, possible security):
    - Fix a bug that could lead to a relay crashing with an assertion
      failure if a buffer of exactly the wrong layout was passed
      to buf_pullup() at exactly the wrong time. Fixes bug 15083;
      bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha. Patch from 'cypherpunks'.

    - Do not assert if the 'data' pointer on a buffer is advanced to the very
      end of the buffer; log a BUG message instead.  Only assert if it is
      past that point. Fixes bug 15083; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.
