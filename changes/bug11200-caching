  o Major bugfixes:
    - When Tor starts with DisabledNetwork set, it would correctly
      conclude that it shouldn't try making circuits, but it would
      mistakenly cache this conclusion and continue believing it even
      when DisableNetwork is set to 0. Fixes the bug introduced by the
      fix for bug 11200; bugfix on 0.2.5.4-alpha.
