  o Major bugfixes:
    - Clients now send the correct address for their chosen rendezvous
      point when trying to access a hidden service. They used to send
      the wrong address, which would still work some of the time because
      they also sent the identity digest of the rendezvous point, and if
      the hidden service happened to try connecting to the rendezvous
      point from a relay that already had a connection open to it,
      the relay would reuse that connection. Now connections to hidden
      services should be more robust and faster. Also, this bug meant
      that clients were leaking to the hidden service whether they were
      on a little-endian (common) or big-endian (rare) system, which for
      some users might have reduced their anonymity. Fixes bug 13151;
      bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.
