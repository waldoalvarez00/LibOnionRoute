  o Minor bugfixes:
    - Warn and drop the circuit if we receive an inbound 'relay early'
      cell. Those used to be normal to receive on hidden service circuits
      due to bug 1038, but the buggy Tor versions are long gone from
      the network so we can afford to resume watching for them. Resolves
      the rest of bug 1038; bugfix on 0.2.1.19.
