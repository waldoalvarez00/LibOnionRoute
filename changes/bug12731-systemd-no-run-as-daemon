  o Distribution:
    - Explicitly disable RunAsDaemon in the systemd unit file.
      Our current systemd unit uses "Type = simple", so systemd does
      not expect tor to fork. If the user has "RunAsDaemon 1" in their
      torrc, then things won't work as expected. This is e.g. the case
      on Debian (and derivatives), since there we pass
      "--defaults-torrc /usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc"
      (that contains "RunAsDaemon 1") by default.
      Patch by intrigeri; resolves ticket 12731.
