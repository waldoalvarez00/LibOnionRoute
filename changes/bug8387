  o Major bugfixes (client):

    - Perform circuit cleanup operations even when circuit
      construction operations are disabled (because the network is
      disabled, or because there isn't enough directory information).
      Previously, when we were not building predictive circuits, we
      were not closing expired circuits either.

      Fixes bug 8387; bugfix on 0.1.1.11-alpha. This bug became visible
      in 0.2.4.10-alpha when we became more strict about when we have
      "enough directory information to build circuits".
