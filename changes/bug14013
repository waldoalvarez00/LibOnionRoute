  o Major bugfixes:
    - When reading a hexadecimal, base-32, or base-64 encoded value
      from a string, always overwrite the complete output buffer. This
      prevents some bugs where we would look at (but fortunately, not
      reveal) uninitialized memory on the stack. Fixes bug 14013;
      bugfix on all versions of Tor.
