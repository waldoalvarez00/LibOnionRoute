  o Major bugfixes:
    - Resume expanding abbreviations for command-line options. The fix
      for bug 4647 accidentally removed our hack from bug 586 that rewrote
      HashedControlPassword to __HashedControlSessionPassword when it
      appears on the commandline (which allowed the user to set her
      own HashedControlPassword in the torrc file while the controller
      generates a fresh session password for each run). Fixes bug 12948;
      bugfix on 0.2.5.1-alpha.
