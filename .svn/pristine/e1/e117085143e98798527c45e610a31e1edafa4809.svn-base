We've split out our TODO into three files:

TODO.02x is the list of items we're planning to get done in the next
stable release.

TODO.external lives in svn under /projects/todo/. It's the list of
external constraints and deliverables that we all need to keep in mind.

TODO.future is the list of other items we plan to get to in later releases.
