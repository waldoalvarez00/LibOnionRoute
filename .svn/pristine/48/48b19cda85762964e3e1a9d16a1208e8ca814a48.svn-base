  o Minor bugfixes:

    - Remove the maximum length of microdescriptor we are willing to
      generate. Occasionally this is needed for routers
      with complex policies or family declarations. Partial fix for
      bug 6404; fix on 0.2.2.6-alpha.

    - Authorities no longer include any router in their
      microdescriptor consensuses for which they couldn't generate or
      agree on a microdescriptor.  Partial fix for bug 6404; fix on
      0.2.2.6-alpha.

    - Move log message when unable to find a microdesc in a
      routerstatus entry to parse time. Previously we'd spam this
      warning every time we tried to figure out which microdescriptors
      to download. Partial fix for bug 6404; fix on 0.2.3.18-rc.
