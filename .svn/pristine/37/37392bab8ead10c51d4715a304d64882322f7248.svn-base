  o Minor bugfixes:

    - Avoid undefined behaviour when parsing the list of supported
      rendezvous/introduction protocols in a hidden service
      descriptor.  Previously, Tor would have confused (as-yet-unused)
      protocol version numbers greater than 32 with lower ones on many
      platforms.  Fixes bug 6827; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha; found by
      George Kadianakis.
