Roadmap
-------

Create bindings for Python, Java, .net, PHP?, Perl? ...

Port changes to Tor 0.2.4 when it gets stable (maybe bugfix 0.2.4 to get it stable)

Cleanup some code unnecessary for the library

Separate data structures into libraries in order to make them reentrant

Fix API calls to do away with the hack in order to make them fully reentrant.
