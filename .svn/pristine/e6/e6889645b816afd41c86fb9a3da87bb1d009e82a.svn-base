  o Major bugfixes (security):
    - Discard extraneous renegotiation attempts once the V3 link
      protocol has been initiated. Failure to do so left us open to
      a remotely triggerable assertion failure. Fixes CVE-2012-2249;
      bugfix on 0.2.3.6-alpha. Reported by "some guy from France".
